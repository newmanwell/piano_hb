This was another Codecademy project. A simple piano was already created in HTML/CSS with the lyrics and notes to the Happy Birthday song. Some of the JavaScript was already created but there was 21 more steps needed to get the piano working properly.
* Two functions that turns the keys blue with the mousedown event is fired.
* Two functions that turns the key back to its original color after mouseup is fired.
* A method at loops through the notes array .forEach()
* Three functions that add/removes lyrics/notes as the song progresses. 
* A function that starts the lyrics/notes from scratch.\
I saved this because I hope to add note sounds to the keys in the future.
